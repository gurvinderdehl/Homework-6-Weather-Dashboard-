# Homework-6-Weather-Dashboard-
# Introduction
The purpose of this Task was to do the following 

Make a weather dashboard with form inputs, so that when I search for a city, I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. Then when I view current weather conditions for that city. I will be presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. When viewing the UV index, the result should be that I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. On top of this I I will get a 5-day forecast that displays the date, weather conditions, the temperature and the humidity. This will remain in the local storage an displayed in the search history. 


### What I learnt?
The most difficult part of this task, was to get all of the functionality above, combining all elements of code together. The most useful part of this task was learning how to access the API's, from the site. Making requests to get that data was the most difficult part of this task. Using JQuery to build my site was so much easier, than using Javascript by itself.


#### For the future 
I would like to research this more and use it within future projects I am going to do. Especially Jquery, as it makes things much easier. I know there are still a few things I can do to make it look better, perhaps more attractive to the naked eye, but based off the demo, I have done what I have needed to. Therefore I am happy with the piece of work I have produced, next time I know, what I can add to do it better.
